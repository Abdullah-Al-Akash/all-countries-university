# all-countries-university

<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>Today I have created a website which is related about all world universities, wow! something interesting ? Yeah!
        Really its very interesting topic, so lets discuss about the website and website technology.</p>
<h6>Firs, I like to say that I have used a API for load some data like university name, university domain and also
        country name. In this website there is a beautiful search field where -</h6>
<h5>
        <li>Someone can write country name and then can get result about all university of this country.</li>
        <li>If someone want to visit any website of the university then you can click visit site button and you will see
                a new tab which carry the website of university.</li>
        <li>The interesting point is if someone write the country name in search box and the click "Enter" button
                he/she/they can see same result. I program a function for Enter button.</li>
        <li>Yeah, I have also fixed error issue like blank search, without country name search type of error I have
                fixed and show in display.</li>
        <li>I also add a very beautiful spinner properly for website loading time. I really enjoy this spinner loader
                very much.</li>
</h5>
<br>
<h6>Now I want to discuss about technology for develop the website-</h6>
<h5>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>DOM(Document Object Model) Manipulation</li>
        <li>ES6</li>
        <li>Bootstrap5</li>
        <li>Rest API</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>Fontawesome for ICON</li>
</h5>
<h4>At the last end, sorry to say that the API's url contained http, not https thats why I can't deploy the website in
        any live
        domain, as any hosting site want to receive https related API. But you can run this website in your Local
        Computer. I also complete this project in my local computer and take single screenshots of the website.</h4>
